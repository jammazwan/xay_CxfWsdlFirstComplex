 * port changed to 9873
 * This project is more complex like 2 of 4 WsdlFirstSimple, only this one has to comment out wsdl2java execution from pom.xml after generating and copying files over. This is because the files had to be modified to consume external entity files instead of the ones generated by wsdl2java. Why? Because this is what would typically be required in corporate environment where the entity files might be shared.
